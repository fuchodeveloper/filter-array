# Simulations 1 - Testing and Debugging

This is a simple test for a function which takes in an array of numbers and divides them into even and odd numbers. Also the test is a guidance on what edge cases you should look out for and implement in your code writing.


# How it works

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/fuchodeveloper/filter-array.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed.
3. Run `npm test` to see what is failing and what you have to implement.
4. Write the code.
5. Run `npm test` again and if test fails.
6. Refractor code.
7. Run `npm test` again.
